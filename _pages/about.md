I am an associate professor at school of computer science and technology in [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/). I received my bachelors' degree and Ph.D degree under the supervision of Prof. Hongfei Lin at Information Retrieval Lab. of Dalian University of Technology ([DUTIR](http://ir.dlut.edu.cn/)). My research interest includes medical human-machine dialogue, psychological computing, recommender system, large language models and other topics related to Natural Language Processing.
